## 5. Magento 2 Select Items In Checkout Cart extension Introduction

In Magento 2, the "Select Items" functionality in the checkout cart is implemented using checkboxes. When you add products to your cart and proceed to the checkout page, each item in your cart will be displayed along with a corresponding checkbox. This checkbox allows you to select or deselect individual items for further actions, such as updating the quantity, removing from the cart, or applying specific discounts.

The "Select Items" checkboxes provide customers with the flexibility to customize their order before finalizing the purchase. By selecting specific items, customers can easily modify their cart contents based on their preferences, budget, or other factors.

To use the "Select Items" feature, customers can simply click on the checkboxes next to the products they wish to include or exclude from the checkout process. After making their selections, they can proceed with other checkout steps, such as providing shipping information, choosing payment options, and placing the order.
